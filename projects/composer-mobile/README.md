# Composer Mobile

A "more native" mobile app for Composer. The goal will be to first release an app on the iOS app store, but this will be the foundation for later work for Android and desktop apps.

## Goals

- Use [Socket Supply Co](https://socketsupply.co/) to wrap existing Composer App.
- Add support for [Universial Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) so that documents from the web can be opened in the app.
- Research the release process so that future updates of the JS bundle do not need a full review.
- Prepare for release to the iOS app store, including app description and properly sized icons.
- Submit the application to the iOS app store for review and and address any issues that the reviewers bring up in the process.
