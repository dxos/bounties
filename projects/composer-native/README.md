# Composer Native

A "more native" app experience for Composer. The goal will be to release three native apps, which, listed in priority are 1) iOS mobile, 2) Mac desktop, and 3) Android mobile.

## Goals

- Use [Socket Supply Co](https://socketsupply.co/) to wrap existing Composer App.
- Add support for [Universial Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) so that documents from the web can be opened in the app.
- Research the release process so that future updates of the JS bundle do not need a full review.
- Prepare for release to the recpective app stores, including app description and properly sized icons.
- Submit the applications to the respective app stores for review and and address any issues that the reviewers bring up in the process.
